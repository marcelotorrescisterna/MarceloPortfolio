# Marcelo Torres: Data Scientist Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my personal Data Scientist Portfolio. My name is **Marcelo Torres** and I am a Data Scientist, Industrial Engineer with a Master´s Degree in Finance. I began my journey in Data Science when I wrote my thesis when I was finishing my engineering career in 2019. I had to work with a dataset of 7 million entries, therefore I was forced to learn Python and it´s most common libraries for working with data such as Pandas and Numpy. Since then and during all 2020 I started my path on Data Science, focusing my effort on learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning. During the whole year I did a great amount of courses from Coursera and Udemy which gave me a great amount of knowledge. I also did several projects in those courses and some of my own which I intend to show in this portfolio.
## Project Number 1: Regression Project
## Project Number 2: Classification Project
## Project Number 3: Deep Learning
## Project Number 4: Implementing LeNet5 For Image Classification
