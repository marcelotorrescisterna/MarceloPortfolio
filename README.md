# Marcelo Torres: Data Scientist Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my personal Data Scientist Portfolio. My name is **Marcelo Torres** and I am a Data Scientist, Industrial Engineer with a Master´s Degree in Finance. I began my journey in Data Science when I wrote my thesis when I was finishing my engineering career back in 2019. I had to work with a dataset of 7 million entries, therefore I was forced to learn Python and it´s most common libraries for working with data such as Pandas and Numpy. Since then and during all 2020 I started my path on Data Science, focusing my effort on learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning. During the whole year I did a great amount of courses from Coursera and Udemy which gave me a great amount of knowledge. I also did several projects in those courses and some of my own which I intend to show in this portfolio.
## Project Number 1: Titanic Kaggle Competition Project
The Titanic Project is a classic project from Kaggle specially for beginners in the data science world. THe goal of this project is to classify if a person as a survivor or not. As it´s usual in the world of Data Science, there are several approaches that can lead to a possible solution. For this particular task I decided to work with Neural Networks. As a personal opinion, Neural Networks are one of my favorite tools.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Before starting any project, it´s very useful to take a look at the data, this is a very common task known as Exploratory Data Analysis.
